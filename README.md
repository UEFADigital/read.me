# UEFA Digital ground rules

Hi friends & welcome to the UEFA Digital organization.
you are about to contribute to UEFA's software, and we appreciate that so here are our github groud rules : 

* Activate 2FA
* You can have whatever login you want, but have your real first name & last name on your profile
* Have a real photo as a profile
* Ask your scrummaster, tech lead, uefa couterpart to add you in a team (we don't like floating account)
* Feel free to create a dedicated profile if you don't want to apply this on your personnal one.

thx for helping us keeping the ground clean & welcome on board.
